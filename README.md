## The Motivation

This project was meant to test my ability to recreate and expand on the mechanics and appearance of Curveball as cleanly and accurately as possible.
There was never any ambition to market or distribute this game, it was purely a hobby project. 
I believe the finished product matches the core functionality nearly perfectly, and furthermore improves the leveling structure.
Also, this game is pretty fun to play, so an offline version is nice to have!

## The Technology
 so far
This game was made in vanilla Java SE 7, GUI implemented with Swing. Tested only on mac OS so far.
